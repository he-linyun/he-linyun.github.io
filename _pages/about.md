I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), advised by [Dr. Eunhye Song](https://sites.google.com/view/eunhyesongphd/home). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Fudan University and master's degree in Statistics from Columbia University.

My research interests lie across many topics.  
* Methodologies: robust simulation analysis, simulation optimization under model risk, non-parametric methods and high-dimensional statistics.  
* Applications: smart manufacturing and digital twins.

<b>I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market!</b>
